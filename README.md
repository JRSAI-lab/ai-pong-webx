A love letter to 1972 Pong, rebuilt in 2025 with the help of AI (Grok by xAI) in under an hour — from dream to playable game.

Pure HTML5 + JavaScript. No build step. Works on desktop, phone, tablet — even in the back seat of a car.

### Why This Exists
Because sometimes you just need to remember:  
You started coding on a Radio Shack with BASIC and dreams bigger than the screen.  
Forty years later, that kid is still inside you — and now you have AI as your co-pilot.

This tiny game is proof:  
**Dreams don’t expire. Tools just got better.**

### Tech
- 100% vanilla JavaScript + Canvas  
- Responsive + mobile-optimized  
- Zero dependencies  
- Runs directly from GitHub Pages

### Made With
- A childhood dream  
- Grok (xAI) as coding partner

> “Any kid who ever typed `10 GOTO 10` can still ship a game today.”  
> — You, right now.
